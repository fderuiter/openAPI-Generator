      Authenticate your account using one of the methods outlined below. The
      response returns a session ID that you can use in subsequent API calls.
      Session IDs time out after a period of inactivity, which varies by Vault.
      Learn more about <a
      href="https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#Session_Mangement">session
      duration and management</a>.


      After acquiring a Vault Session ID, include it on every subsequent API
      call inside the `Authorization` HTTP request header.


      #### Basic Authorization


      |Name          |Description                                |

      |:-------------|:------------------------------------------|

      |`Authorization`|{`sessionId`}|


      Alternatively, you can use Salesforce&trade; or OAuth2/OIDC Delegated
      Requests.


      The Vault API also accepts Vault Session IDs as Bearer tokens. Include
      `Bearer` keyword to send Vault Session IDs with as bearer tokens:


      #### Bearer Token Authorization


      |Name          |Description                                |

  - name: Authentication > Delegated Access
    description: "Vault’s delegated access feature provides a secure and audited process for you to designate another user to handle Vault responsibilities on your behalf. Vault tracks all activities performed by the delegate and logs their activities in audit trails that meet compliance standards. Learn more <a href=\"https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/15015\">about\_delegated access in Vault Help</a>.\n\nWith the Vault REST API’s delegated access endpoints, you can generate a delegated session ID for any Vaults where you have delegate access. This allows you to call the Vault REST API on behalf of any user who granted you delegate access. For example, a user may grant delegate access to an IT professional for help troubleshooting a problem. Your organization may also utilize delegate access for shared accounts, such as a “Migration User.”\n\nDelegation is Vault-specific: If your IT professional needs access to both your PromoMats and Submissions Vaults, you will need to grant them delegate access in both Vaults."

      [https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Direct_Data](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Vault_Java_SDK)


      The Direct Data API provides high-speed read-only data access to Vault.
      The following endpoints allow you to retrieve available Direct Data files
      and download them. Learn more about the [Direct Data
      API](https://developer.veevavault.com/directdata).


      Your security profile and permission set must grant the _Access_ and
      _Direct Data_ permissions for the Vault REST API.


      Direct Data API is not enabled by default. You must contact your Veeva
      representative to enable it in your Vault. Veeva EDC supports Study File
      Format instead of Direct Data API. For more information, see the [Clinical
      Data Veeva Developer

      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Vault_Query_Language



      When an application invokes a query call, it passes in a **Vault Query
      Language (VQL)** statement (a SQL-like statement) that specifies the
      object to query (in the `FROM` clause), the fields to retrieve (in the
      `SELECT` clause), and any optional filters to apply (in the `WHERE` and
      `FIND` clauses) to narrow your results.  Learn more in the <a

      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Metadata_Definition_Language



      Vault is configured with a set of <a
      href="https://developer.veevavault.com/mdl/components">component types</a>
      that make up its configuration elements. Use MDL to create, describe
      (read), update, and drop (delete) Vault components and manage its
      configuration. Learn more in our <a

  - name: Metadata Definition Language (MDL) > Asynchronous MDL Requests
    description: >-
      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Execute_MDL_Async_Top


      Instead of a [synchronous
      request](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Execute_MDL), you must
      use an [asynchronous
      request](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Execute_MDL_Async) if
      you are executing one of the following operations on 10,000+ `raw` object
      records:


      - Enabling lifecycles
          
      - Enabling or disabling object types
          
      - Adding or removing a field
          
      - Updating the max length of any variable-length field, such as _Text_,
      _Long Text_, or _Rich Text_
          
      - Adding or removing an `Index`
          
      - Changing the fields that compose an `Index` or otherwise would cause
      reindexing to occur
          

      A raw object is a Vault object where the `data_store` attribute is set to
      `raw`. To determine if an object is a raw object, retrieve the value of
      the `data_store` parameter from the [Retrieve Object
      Metadata](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_Object_Metadata)
      endpoint. Learn more about [raw objects in Vault
      Help](https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/62987/).


      After initiating an asynchronous request, your raw object’s
      `configuration_state` becomes `IN_DEPLOYMENT`. While a raw object is
      `IN_DEPLOYMENT`, you cannot edit its fields, list layouts, or indexes. If
      your raw object deployment request has not yet begun execution, you can
      [cancel](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Cancel_HVO) the
      deployment.


      If you don't need to use the [asynchronous
      request](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Execute_MDL_Async), it
      is best practice to use the [synchronous
      request](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Execute_MDL).
  - name: Documents
    description: >+
      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Documents



      Vault is a highly configurable system designed to reflect the business
      model of documents. Each Vault can have different document types, document
      fields, etc. The Document Metadata APIs allow you to query the Vault to
      understand what document-based metadata is available to use. Learn about
      <a href="https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/21581">Documents &
      Binders</a> in Vault Help.


      **Note:** Because Vault completely indexes the document content and
      metadata, there is a delay before a new document becomes fully available.

      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_Document_Types



      Document type refers both to the structure of hierarchical fields (Type >
      Subtype > Classification) that determines the relevant document fields,
      rendition types, and other settings for a document, and to the highest
      level in that hierarchy. Learn about <a

      Types</a> in Vault Help.

  - name: Documents > Retrieve Documents
    description: >+
      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_Documents



      The following rules govern document retrieval:


      * Vault only returns documents to which the logged in user has access to,
      even if more documents exist.

      * Vault only returns the latest version of each document. To return every
      version of a document, use the `versionscope=all` query parameter.

      * Vault returns a maximum of 200 documents per page. You can lower this
      number using the `limit` query parameter.


      #### Identifying Binders


      The document pseudo-field `binder__v` indicates whether the returned
      document is a document or a binder.

      The value of `true` means it is a binder, `false` or absence of this field
      means it is a document. If it is a binder, the binder sections are not
      listed as part of the response and must be determined using the <a
      href="https://developer.veevavault.com/api/24.3#Retrieve_Binder">Retrieve
      Binder API</a> with the `depth=all` query parameter.


      #### Identifying CrossLink Documents


      A document pseudo-field `crosslink__v` indicates whether the returned
      document is a regular document (`false`) or a CrossLink document (`true`).

      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Delete_Documents_API



      After deleting documents, the API allows you to retrieve their IDs for up
      to 30 days. The deleted files themselves are removed from the server and
      can only be retrieved by Vault Support. Note that you cannot delete
      checked out documents unless you have the Power Delete permission. Learn

  - name: Documents > Export Documents
    description: >+
      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Export_Documents



      The Export Documents API allows you to use the document `id` field to
      export a set of documents to your Vault's <a
      href="https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#FTP">file staging server</a>.
      For example, you could use <a
      href="https://developer.veevavault.com/vql/#sending-queries">VQL</a> to
      query the `id` of all documents from 2016 where `type__v` = `Promotional
      Piece`, then pass the results into the Export Documents API. This starts
      an asynchronous job whose status you can check with the Retrieve Document
      Export Results API.


      You can export the following artifacts for a given document:


      * Source document

      * Renditions


      You can export all versions or choose to export only the latest version.


      This API does not support the following:


      * Fields

      * Attachments

      * Audit trails

      * Related documents

      * Signature Pages

      * Overlays

      * Protected renditions


      Note that the maximum number of document versions (source files) you can
      export per request is 10,000.

      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Vault_Retrieve_Binders_API_Reference



      Binders organize documents, sections, and other binders into a
      hierarchical structure that is useful for packaging related documents
      together for easier management or eventual publishing. Binders are a kind
      of document and many of the Document API calls, such as metadata,
      retrieving and setting properties, security, etc. can be used directly on
      a binder and will not be replicated here. All API calls related to files
      and renditions will not work on a binder object. Binders do have unique
      APIs that allow for interrogating and manipulating the binder structure.

      Each Vault is configured with a set of standard objects (`product__v`,
      `country__v`, `study__v`, etc.). These vary by application and
      configuration.


      Vault is also configured with a set of system objects (`user__sys`,
      `person__sys`, `locale__sys`, etc.) These are available for all Vault
      applications and configurations.


      Admins may also create custom objects (`region__c`, `agency__c`,
      `manufacturer__c`, etc.). Vault limits the total number of custom objects
      that Admins can create in a single Vault. By default, the limit is 20.


      * The API supports retrieval of Vault Objects and their metadata.

      * The API does not support creating or updating Vault Objects. This must
      be done by Admin in the UI.


      Each object can have multiple object records. For example, the
      `product__v` object may have records for products named `CholeCap`,
      `Nyaxa`, and `WonderDrug`. All object records are user-defined.


      * The API supports retrieval of Vault Object Records and their metadata.

      * The API supports creating, updating, and deleting object records.

  - name: Vault Objects > Object Types
    description: >-
      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Object_Types


      Vault Objects can be can be partitioned into Object Types. For example, a
      Product object may have two different object types: "Pharmaceutic Product"
      and "Medical Device Product". These object types may share some fields but
      also have fields only used in each object type. By using object types, two
      product groups can not only manage data specific to their business but
      also easily report on products in both groups.
  - name: Vault Objects > Object Roles
    description: >-
      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Object_Roles


      Object records can have different roles available to them depending on
      their type and lifecycles. There are a set of standard roles that ship
      with Vault: `owner__v`, `viewer__v`, and `editor__v`. In addition, Admins
      can create custom roles defined per lifecycle. Not all object records will
      have users and groups assigned to roles. Learn more about roles on object
      records in <a href="https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/36440">Vault
      Help</a>.


      Through the object record role APIs, you can:

      * Retrieve available roles on object records

      * Retrieve who is currently assigned to a role

      * Add additional users and groups to a role

      * Remove users and groups from roles


      Note that all user and group information is returned as IDs, so you need
      to use the Retrieve User or Retrieve Group API to determine the name.

  - name: Vault Objects > Object Page Layouts
    description: >-
      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Page_Layouts


      Object page layouts are defined at the object or object-type level and
      control the information displayed to a user on the object record detail
      page. Objects that include multiple object types can define a different
      layout for each type. Learn more about <a
      href="https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/26387">configuring object
      page layouts in Vault Help</a>.


      The page layout APIs consider the authenticated user’s permissions, so
      fields which are hidden from the authenticated user will not be included
      in the API response. For example, field-level security, object controls,
      and other object-level permissions are considered. Record-level
      permissions such as atomic security are not considered. Layout rules are
      not applied, but instead have their configurations returned as metadata.
      Both active and inactive fields are included in the response.
  - name: Vault Objects > Merge Object Records
    description: >-
      Duplicate records in Vault can happen due to migrations, integrations, or
      day-to-day activities and may be difficult to resolve. Vault provides a
      solution to duplicate records by allowing you to merge two records
      together. You can only initiate record merges through the Vault API or the
      [Vault Java SDK](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Record_Merges), and
      you cannot initiate a record merge through the Vault UI.


      Your organization may want to create custom [Record Merge Event
      Handlers](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Record_Merge_Event_Handlers)
      with the Vault Java SDK, which can execute custom logic immediately when a
      record merge begins or after a record merge completes. For example,
      directly after a merge starts, you can retrieve the field values on the
      duplicate record. Directly after the merge completes, you can update any
      desired information from the duplicate record to the main record. This
      overrides the default merge behavior which does not copy data between the
      duplicate and main record.

        <li>When you create a new Roll-up field, Vault does not automatically calculate a value for existing parent records.</li> <li>When you upload a large number of records using Record Migration Mode, Vault bypasses automatic roll-up calculations.</li></ul>

      When performing a full recalculation, Vault evaluates all Roll-up fields
      on an object asynchronously.


      Record triggers on parent records do not fire when Roll-up fields are
      updated.

      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Vault_Roles_API_Reference



      Documents and binders can have different roles available to them depending
      on their type and lifecycles. There are a set of standard roles that ship
      with Vault: `owner__v`, `viewer__v`, and `editor__v`. In addition, Admins
      can create custom roles defined per lifecycle. Learn more about roles in
      <a href="https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/2662">Vault Help</a>.


      Through the Role APIs, you can:


      * Retrieve available roles on documents and binders

      * Determine who can be assigned to roles

      * Retrieve default users who are assigned automatically within the Vault
      UI

      * Retrieve who is currently assigned to a role

      * Add additional users and groups to a role

      * Remove users and groups from roles


      All responses return user and group IDs. To determine user and group names
      and other data, use the Retrieve User or Retrieve Group API.

      [https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Object_Workflows](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Object_Workflows)


      A workflow is a series of steps configured in Vault to align with specific
      business processes. The different types of steps offer a flexible way to
      organize a wide variety of processes for an object record, including
      assigning tasks to users, sending notifications, updating fields, and
      changing a record's lifecycle state or sharing settings. Workflow tasks
      can allow users to enter comments, choose verdicts (approve, deny, etc.),
      populate fields, or provide eSignatures.


      Object workflows are specific to a single lifecycle, meaning that one (1)
      workflow cannot apply to multiple object lifecycles. A single object
      record can only be in one (1) workflow at a time. Learn more about [Object

      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Vault_Lifecycles_API_Reference



      Document lifecycles are the sequences of states (Draft, In Review, etc.) a
      document goes through during its life. A lifecycle can be simple (two
      states requiring users to manually move between states) or very complex
      (multiple states with different security and workflows that automatically
      move the document to another state). In Vault, lifecycles simplify the
      implementation of business logic that traditionally required custom coding
      or time-consuming manual setup.


      Lifecycle states are the ordered states within a lifecycle representing
      the stages a document transitions through as users create, review,
      approve, and eventually archive or replace it. A set of business rules
      applies to each state and defines what happens to the document in that
      state. Admins define these rules for each lifecycle state and Vault
      automatically applies them to every document that enters the state.

      This API allows you to initiate of the following user action types:


      * **Workflow** (legacy): This action starts the specified legacy workflow.
      Only legacy workflows that are already configured and active for the
      selected lifecycle are available. To start a document workflow, see <a
      href="https://developer.veevavault.com/api/24.3#Multi_Document_Workflows">Document
      Workflows</a>.

      * **State Change**: This action allows the user to manually move a
      document into a different lifecycle state. Vault enforces entry criteria
      and entry actions for the state change.

      * **Controlled Copy**: This action is available in QualityDocs Vaults and
      with the QualityOne application family. It allows the user to generate and
      distribute a controlled copy.

      * **Create Presentation**: This action is only available in PromoMats and
      Medcomms. It creates multiple *Multichannel Slide* documents and a
      *Multichannel Presentation* binder from a single document. This applies to
      Vaults that are configured for Engage integration or CLM integration.

      * **Create Email Fragment**: This action is only available in PromoMats
      and MedComms Vaults that are configured for *Approved Email Integration*.
      It creates an email fragment for a document by applying a master email
      fragment.

      retrieve information about a session, and, if necessary, abort a session.

      1. **Upload File Parts**: Use the `upload_session_id` from step 1 to
      upload parts of a file to an upload session. File parts can be from 5-50MB
      by default, although limits for your Vault may vary.

      3. **Commit Upload Session**: After you upload all file parts, use this

      Use the additional helper endpoints in this section to manage upload
      sessions. Each Vault allows up to 50 active upload sessions at a time. By
      default, upload sessions remain active for 72 hours after creation. If a
      session expires before it is committed, Vault will auto-purge all parts of
      the upload.

      **Note:** To take advantage of functionality available in later versions,
      the Vault Loader API uses Vault Loader v21.3 or later:

      <ul>
        <li>With API v21.3 and earlier, Vault Loader passes v21.3 through to underlying APIs. For example, a request to Vault Loader API v21.2 will use the v21.3 Vault Objects, Documents, and VQL APIs.</li>
        <li>With API v22.1+, Vault Loader passes the API request version through to underlying APIs. For example, a request to Vault Loader API v22.2 will use the v22.2 Vault Objects, Documents, and VQL APIs as specified.</li>

      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Vault_Java_SDK



      After you’ve deployed Vault Java SDK code, you may need to perform actions
      on your code besides additional deployment with a VPK. For example, you
      may need to download source code or disable a single file.


      You also may need to delete a single file rather than all files. However,
      we do not recommend using the following methods to deploy code as you may
      introduce or delete code which breaks existing deployed code. For best
      practices, use the <a
      href="https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Deploy">VPK Deploy method</a>.

  - name: Managing Vault Java SDK > Queues
    description: >-
      https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Queues


      Vault Spark is a message queue system that enables applications to send
      and receive messages to and from durable queues using a First-in,
      First-Out (FIFO) method.


      The following endpoints allow you to manage queues for <a
      href="https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Vault_Integrations">Spark
      Messaging</a> and SDK job queues.


      The current user must have the relevant *Admin: Spark Queues* or *Admin:
      SDK Job Queues* to perform actions on each queue type. For example, if the
      API user does not have access to SDK job queues, **Retrieve All Queues**
      only returns available Spark messaging queues.

    description: "[https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Custom_Pages](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Custom_Pages)\n\nThe Custom Pages APIs allow you to manage the client code for Custom Pages using a client code distribution. The client code distribution contains:\n\n- The client code that defines how Custom Pages display in the Vault UI\n    \n- Metadata that describes the distribution. This metadata must be placed in a manifest file (\\`distribution-manifest.json\\`) in the distribution's root directory.\n    \n\nClient code distributions are [uploaded](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Add_Replace_Single_Distribution) to and downloaded from Vault as a ZIP file. Learn more about [creating a client code distribution for Custom Pages](https://developer.veevavault.com/custompages/).\n\nWhen creating Custom Pages, you can also use the Vault REST API to:\n\n- Create a \\`Page\\` component using [MDL](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/24.3/#Execute_MDL).

        This endpoint allows you to upload a content file to be referenced by a
        component.


        Once uploaded, Vault stores the file in a generic files staging area
        where they will remain until referenced by a component. Once referenced,
        Vault cannot access the named file from the staging area.

      description: >-
        https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Execute_MDL_Async


        This asynchronous endpoint executes the given MDL script on a Vault.


        While you can execute any MDL script with this endpoint, it is required
        if you’re operating on 10,000+ `raw` object records and executing one of
        the following operations:


        * Enabling lifecycles

        * Enabling or disabling object types

        * Adding or removing a field

        * Updating the max length of any variable-length field, such as *Text*,
        *Long Text*, or *Rich Text*

        * Adding or removing an `Index`

        * Changing the fields that compose an `Index` or otherwise would cause
        reindexing to occur


        After initiating this request, your raw object’s `configuration_state`
        becomes `IN_DEPLOYMENT`. While a raw object is `IN_DEPLOYMENT`, you
        cannot edit its fields, list layouts, or indexes. If your raw object
        deployment request has not yet begun execution, you can <a
        href="https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Cancel_HVO">cancel</a>
        the deployment.


        This endpoint can only queue one asynchronous change at a time. If you
        have multiple requests, you must wait for the previous request to
        complete or use a VPK.

        https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_All_Binders



        In Vault, binders are just another kind of document. Therefore, to
        retrieve a list of all binders in your Vault, you must use the same API
        endpoint to retrieve documents. By searching the response, you can
        distinguish binders from documents by using the document field
        `binder__v` set to `true` or `false`. See the response details below.
        Note that nested binders (a binder contained within another binder) are
        not retrieved.


        This endpoint does not retrieve binder sections, which means the
        response will not include binders within other binder sections. To
        retrieve all metadata configured on a binder, including sections, you
        must use the binder IDs retrieved from this request in the <a
        href="https://developer.veevavault.com/api/24.3#Retrieve_Binder">Retrieve
        Binder</a> endpoint.


        Alternatively, you can use VQL to find just binders `SELECT id FROM
        binders`. See <a
        href="https://developer.veevavault.com/vql/#Query_Syntax_Structure">VQL
        documentation</a> for details.

        **Note:** If you need to create more than one document, it is best

        Create a single document.


        The API supports all security settings except document lifecycle role
        defaults. You must create documents through the UI if your documents
        require document lifecycle role defaults. Learn more about <a

        Reclassify allows you to change the document type of an existing
        document or assign a document type to an unclassified document. This
        endpoint is analogous to the _Reclassify_ action in the Vault UI.


        A document "type" is the combination of the `type__v`, `subtype__v`, and
        `classification__v` fields on a document. When you reclassify, Vault may
        add or remove certain fields on the document. Add these new fields and
        values to the body of this request. If a new required field is missing,
        the error response will list the name of the required field. The API
        does not currently support bulk reclassify.


        Not all documents are eligible for reclassification. For example, you
        can only reclassify the latest version of a document and you cannot
        reclassify a checked out document. To reclassify more than one document,
        use the [Reclassify Multiple
        Documents](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Reclassify_Multiple_Documents)
        endpoint.

        **Note:** If you need to create more than one document version, it is
        best practice to use the


        <a
        href="https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Create_Document_Versions_Bulk">bulk
        API</a>


        .


        Add a new draft version of an existing document. You can choose to
        either use the existing source file or a new source file. These actions
        increase the target document’s minor version number. This is analogous
        to using the _Create Draft_ action in the UI.


        Note that not all documents are eligible for draft creation. For
        example, you cannot create a draft of a checked out document. Learn more

                    latestContent: Create a new draft version from the existing
                    document in the Vault. This does not require uploading a
                    file. This is analogous to the Copy file from current
                    version option in the Create Draft UI.


                    uploadedContent: Create a new draft version by uploading the
                    document source file. This requires uploading a new source
                    file with an additional file body parameter. The maximum
                    allowed file size is 4GB. This is analogous to the Upload a
                    new file option in the Create Draft UI.


                    This parameter is only required to create a new draft
                    version from an existing document or by uploading a source
                    file. To create a new version for a placeholder document,
                    you must omit this parameter

                    * If createDraft=uploadedContent, use this parameter to
                    include the new document source file.

                    * If your target document is a placeholder, use this
                    parameter to upload a source file and create a new draft
                    version of the document.

        This endpoint allows you to create multiple documents at once with a CSV
        input file.


        * The maximum CSV input file size is 1GB.

        * The values in the input must be UTF-8 encoded.

        * CSVs must follow the <a href
        ="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180">standard format.</a>

        * The maximum batch size is 500.


        Note that this API does not support adding multi-value relationship
        fields by name. To add multi-value fields, you must first retrieve the
        ID values and add them to the relationship field.


        The API supports all security settings except document lifecycle role
        defaults. You must create documents through the UI if your documents
        require document lifecycle role defaults. Learn more about <a
        href="https://platform.veevavault.help/en/gr/6572/">document lifecycle
        role defaults in Vault Help</a>.

        Reclassify allows you to change the document type of an existing
        document or assign a document type to an unclassified document. This
        endpoint is analogous to the _Reclassify_ action in the Vault UI.


        A document "type" is the combination of the `type__v`, `subtype__v`, and
        `classification__v` fields on a document. When you reclassify, Vault may
        add or remove certain fields on the document. Add these new fields and
        values to the body of this request. If a new required field is missing,
        the error response will list the name of the required field. The API
        does not currently support bulk reclassify.


        Not all documents are eligible for reclassification. For example, you
        can only reclassify the latest version of a document and you cannot
        reclassify a checked out document. Learn more about

        https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_Deleted_Documents



        Retrieve IDs of documents deleted within the past 30 days.


        After documents and document versions are deleted, their IDs remain
        available for retrieval for 30 days. After that, they cannot be
        retrieved. This request supports optional parameters to narrow the
        results to a specific date and time range within the past 30 days.


        To completely restore a document deleted within the last 30 days,
        contact Veeva support.

        Undo Collaborative Authoring checkout on up to 500 documents at once.
        Learn more about [Collaborative Authoring in Vault
        Help](https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/56842).


        To undo basic checkout, see [Delete Document
        Lock](http://localhost:8400/api/25.1/#Delete_Document_Lock).


        Some HTTP clients do not support `DELETE` requests with a body. As a
        workaround for these cases, you can simulate this request using the
        `POST` method with the `_method=DELETE` query parameter.


        On `SUCCESS`, Vault returns a `responseStatus` and `responseMessage` for
        each `id` in the request body. Partial success is allowed, meaning some
        documents in the batch may succeed while others fail. For any failed
        documents, the response includes a reason for the failure.


        **Request**


        ``` bash

        https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Create_Multiple_Attachments



        Create multiple document attachments in bulk with a JSON or CSV input
        file. You must first load the attachments to the <a
        href="https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#FTP">file staging
        server</a>. This works for version-specific attachments and attachments
        at the document level. If the attachment already exists, Vault uploads
        the attachment as a new version of the existing attachment. Learn more

        Delete multiple annotations. You must have _Annotate_ permission on the
        specified document versions to delete annotations.


        Some HTTP clients do not support `DELETE` requests with a body. As a
        workaround for these cases, you can simulate this request using the
        `POST` method and using the `_method=DELETE` query parameter.


        Upload parameters as a JSON or CSV file. You can delete up to 500
        annotations per batch.

        Create up to 500 annotation replies.


        Prepare a JSON-formatted list of annotation reply objects. Each object
        must contain the `id_sys`, `document_version_id__sys`, and the
        annotation field(s) to be set, and a `placemark` object containing the
        `type__sys` and `reply_parent__sys` fields.


        On `SUCCESS`, the response includes the document version ID, global
        version ID, and ID and version of each successfully created reply. See
        [Create
        Annotations](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Create_Multiple_Annotations)
        for details. Replies that were not added successfully are reported with
        an error message.

                    distribution channel where the document is being made
                    available. If no website record is specified, Vault will
                    assume the request is for Approved Email.

                  description: >
                    Optional: Include the tokenGroup request parameter to group
                    together generated tokens for multiple documents in order to
                    display the documents being referenced in the same viewer.
                    This value accepts strings of alphanumeric characters (a-z,
                    A-Z, 0-9, and single consecutive underscores) up to 255
                    characters in length. The token that is passed as a URL
                    parameter to the External Viewer is the primary token and
                    the document it references will be displayed normally.
                    However, any additional documents that have tokens generated
                    with the same case-sensitive tokenGroup string will be
                    displayed in a sidebar of the viewer. The order of documents
                    in the sidebar depends on the order in which the tokens are
                    generated. If multiple tokens are generated with one
                    request, the documents will be ordered top-to-bottom based
                    on the order they are passed to the docIds parameter. For
                    example: If passing the parameters docIds=101,102,103,104
                    and tokenGroup=group_1 with the request, the top-to-bottom
                    order in the sidebar will be documents 101, 102, 103, 104.
                    If a new request is then made with the parameters docIds=105
                    and tokenGroup=group_1, document 105 will be added below
                    document 104 in the previous list.

        https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Reclassify_Binder



        Reclassify allows you to change the document type of an existing binder.
        A document "type" is the combination of the `type__v`, `subtype__v`, and
        `classification__v` fields on a binder. When you reclassify, Vault may
        add or remove certain fields on the binder. You can only reclassify the
        latest version of a binder and only one binder at a time. The API does
        not currently support Bulk Reclassify.

        Change the object types assigned to object records. Any field values
        which exist on both the original and new object type will carry over to
        the new type. All other field values will be removed, as only fields on
        the new type are valid. You can set field values on the new object type
        in the CSV input.

        https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Assign_Users_Groups_to_Roles_Objects



        Assign users and groups to roles on an object record in bulk.


        * The maximum CSV input file size is 1GB.

        * The values in the input must be UTF-8 encoded.

        * CSVs must follow the <a
        href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180">standard
        format.</a>

        * The maximum batch size is 500.


        Assigning users and groups to roles is additive, and duplicate groups
        are ignored. For example, if groups 1 and 2 are currently assigned to a
        particular role and you assign groups 2 and 3 to the same role, the
        final list of groups assigned to the role will be 1, 2, and 3.

        Given a page layout `name`, retrieve the metadata for that specific page
        layout.


        The page layout APIs consider the authenticated user’s permissions, so
        fields that are hidden from the authenticated user will not be included
        in the API response. For example, field-level security, object controls,
        and other object-level permissions are considered. Record-level
        permissions such as atomic security are not considered. Both active and
        inactive fields are included in the response.


        This endpoint returns metadata without layout rules applied, instead
        returning layout rule configurations as metadata. If a layout rule
        references the currently authenticated user, this endpoint returns the
        `@User` token instead of resolving it to the value of the authenticated
        user.

      summary: Initiate Record Merge
      description: >-
        Initiate a record merge operation in bulk. Starts a record merge job.


        When merging two records together, you must select one record to be the
        `main_record_id` and one record to be the `duplicate_record_id`. The
        merging process updates all inbound references (including attachments)
        from other objects that point to the `duplicate_record_id` and moves
        those over to the `main_record_id`. Field values on the`main_record_id`
        are not changed, and when the process is complete, Vault deletes the
        `duplicate_record_id`. Record merges do not trigger [record
        triggers](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#About_Record_Triggers).


        You can only merge two records together in a single operation, one
        `main_record_id` and one `duplicate_record_id`. This is called a merge
        set.


        If you have multiple `duplicate_record_id`s you wish to merge into the
        same`main_record_id`, you need to create multiple merge sets and execute
        multiple record merges.


        - The values in the input must be UTF-8 encoded.
            
        - CSVs must follow the standard RFC 4180 format, with some
        [exceptions](https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#CSV_RFC_Deviations).
            
        - The maximum batch size is 10 merge sets.
            

        The object must have **Enable Merges** configured, and the initiating
        user must have the correct permissions such as the _Application: Object:
        Merge Records_ permission. Learn more about the [configuration required

        When performing a full recalculation, Vault evaluates all Roll-up fields
        on an object asynchronously.


        This endpoint is equivalent to the _Recalculate Roll-up Fields_ action
        in the Vault UI. While a recalculation is running, Admins cannot start
        another recalculation using either the Vault REST API or Vault UI.

        Currency is a field type available on all Vault objects. Whenever a user
        populates a local currency field value, Vault automatically populates
        the related corporate currency field value, except in the following
        scenarios:


        * Admins change the Corporate Currency setting for the vault

        * Admins update the Rate setting for the local currency used by a record


        This endpoint updates the `field_corp__sys` field values of an object
        record based on the Rate of the currency, denoted by the
        `local_currency__sys` field of the specified record. Learn more about <a

        * The maximum batch size is 1000.


        Assigning users and groups to document roles is additive. For example,
        if groups 1, 2, and 3 are currently assigned to a particular role and
        you assign groups 3, 4, and 5 to the same role, the final list of groups
        assigned to the role will be 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Users and groups (IDs)
        in the input that are either invalid (not recognized) or cannot be
        assigned to a role due to permissions are ignored and not processed.

        Complete an open workflow task for a multi-item workflow. This endpoint
        does not support initiating task actions requiring eSignatures (where
        esignature is true). To provide multiple verdicts for items without
        completing an open workflow task, use [Manage Multi-item Workflow
        Content](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Manage_Multi-item_Workflow_Content).


        #### Body Parameters


        Controls with `required=true` in the [Retrieve Workflow Task Action
        Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details)
        response must be provided. If a control (such as `verdict`) defines a
        set of required fields, those must also be provided. For example, a
        specific verdict may prompt for comments, reasons, or capacities.


        For workflows where `type` is set to `multidocworkflow` and
        `cardinality` is set to `One`, Vault pre-populates document field values
        in field prompts. If you include keys for field prompts without values,
        Vault submits a blank field value on the document.


        In the body of the request, upload parameters as a JSON file. This
        request may require the following body parameters:


        | **Name** | **Description** |

        | --- | --- |

        | `verdict_public_key__c`  <br>**conditional** | The verdict name.
        Retrieve possible verdict `name` values by sending a request to
        [Retrieve Workflow Task Action
        Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details).
        |

        | `reason__c`  <br>**conditional** | The reason name. Retrieve possible
        reason `name` values by sending a request to [Retrieve Workflow Task
        Action
        Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details).
        |

        | `capacity__c`  <br>**conditional** | The capacity name. Retrieve
        possible capacity `name` values by sending a request to [Retrieve
        Workflow Task Action
        Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details).
        |


        #### **Example JSON Request Body: Single Verdict**


        ``` json

        {
           "verdict_public_key__c": "verdict_not_approved__c",

        }

         ```

        #### **Example JSON Request Body: Multiple Verdicts**

        [https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Reassign_Multi-item_Workflow_Task](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Reassign_Multi-item_Workflow_Task)


        Reassign an open workflow task to another user for a multi-item
        workflow.


        You cannot reassign a task to a user who is already assigned to that
        specific task, has completed that task, or is configured with a
        restricted role. However, you can reassign a user to continuing
        iterations of the same task if an Admin has enabled users in the
        workflow to only complete one task.


        #### Example Response


        ``` json

        {
            "responseStatus": "SUCCESS"
        }

         ```

        #### Response Details


        Returns `SUCCESS` if the task was successfully reassigned. Vault
        notifies the new task owner and the previous task owner of the
        reassignment.

        Update the due date of an assigned workflow task. This endpoint supports
        single and multi-item workflows.


        If the workflow is configured to set all task due dates to the workflow
        due date, updates to individual task due dates will not affect the
        overall workflow due date. You cannot update task due dates that are
        configured to sync with an object or document field.

        Manage content in a multi-item workflow without completing an open
        workflow task. For example, you can use this endpoint to provide
        verdicts for specific items without completing the task. This endpoint
        does not support initiating task actions requiring eSignatures (where
        `esignature` is `true`).


        #### **Body Parameters**


        Controls with `required=true` in the [Retrieve Workflow Task Action
        Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details)
        response can be provided. If a control (such as `verdict`) defines a set
        of required fields, those can also be provided. For example, a specific
        verdict may prompt for comments, reasons, or capacities.


        In the body of the request, upload parameters as a JSON file. This
        request may require the following body parameters:


        | **Name** | **Description** |

        | --- | --- |

        | `verdict_public_key__c`  <br>**conditional** | The verdict name.
        Retrieve possible verdict `name` values by sending a request to
        [Retrieve Workflow Task Action
        Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details).
        |

        | `reason__c`  <br>**conditional** | The reason name. Retrieve possible
        reason `name` values by sending a request to [Retrieve Workflow Task
        Action
        Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details).

        [https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_Application_License_Usage](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_Application_License_Usage)


        Retrieve your current license usage compared to the licenses that your
        organization has purchased. This information is similar to the
        information displayed in the Vault UI from **Admin > Settings > General
        Settings**.


        Some Vaults use multiple applications, for example, a RIM Vault with
        Submissions and Registrations. In these Vaults, users have a license
        value for each application they can access. Application licensing allows
        Vault to track available licenses at the application level, but does not
        control a user’s access in most Vaults. A user assigned to multiple
        applications will use one (1) application license per application. Learn
        more about [Application Licenses in Vault
        Help](https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/5721/).

        #### Response Details


        The response contains the following application license details:


        | Name | Description |

        | --- | --- |

        | `doc_count` | PromoMats and Veeva Medical only: The number of document
        views across all users with view-based license type against a
        pre-purchased set of views for the Vault. Learn more about [view-based
        user licenses in Vault
        Help](https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/5721/). |

        | `application_name` | The API name of this application license, for
        example, `pm_multichannel__v`. |

        | `user_licensing` | An array of the available application licenses for
        the given `application_name`. |

        | `user_licensing.licensed` | The maximum number of users who can be
        assigned to this application license. For example, if the `full__v`
        application license has a `licensed` value of `50`, you can assign this
        license to a maximum of 50 users. |

        | `user_licensing.used` | The number of users currently assigned to this
        application license. To determine the number of application licenses
        available for assignment, subtract `used` from `licensed`. For example,
        if your application license has a `licensed` value of `50` and a `used`
        value of `40`, you can assign 10 more users to this application license.
        |

        | `user_licensing.shared` | Indicates if this user license is shared. |

        Use caution when editing picklist labels or names. When these attributes
        are changed, they affect all existing document and object metadata that
        refer to the picklist. For users in the UI who are accustomed to seeing
        a particular selection, the changes may cause confusion. This may also
        break existing integrations that access picklist values via the API.

        https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_Object_Audit_History



        Retrieve complete audit history for a single object record.


        Vault does not audit individual field values for newly created records.
        For example, the audit trail for a new *Product* record would only
        include a single entry, and the *Event Description* would be “Product:
        CholeCap created”. We recommend <a
        href="https://developer.veevavault.com/api/24.3#Retrieve_Object_Record">exporting
        the current record</a> along with the audit trail to ensure a complete
        export of all values. When a user deletes an object record, the audit
        trail captures all field values.

        Create a new SDK request profiling session. Profiling sessions allow
        developers to troubleshoot custom code and improve code quality by
        analyzing results at the SDK request level.


        Vault starts the profiling session immediately on creation. Profiling
        sessions run for either 20 minutes or up to 10,000 SDK requests,
        whichever comes first. To end a session early, use the [End Profiling
        Session](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#End_Profiling_Session)
        endpoint. Once ended, a session’s `status` is `processing__sys` while
        Vault prepares the data, which may take about 15 minutes. Once the
        `status` is `complete__sys`, the data is available for download with the
        [Download Profiling Session
        Results](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Download_Profiling_Session_Results)
        endpoint.


        Only one profiling session can be active at a time. Because sessions
        begin immediately on creation, you cannot create a new session until the
        current session becomes inactive. Additionally, each Vault can only
        retain profiling session data for up to 10 sessions. If your Vault
        already has 10 profiling sessions, you must [Delete a Profiling
        Session](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Delete_Profiling_Session)
        before creating a new one.

        [https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#End_Profiling_Session](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#End_Profiling_Session)


        Terminate a profiling session early. By default, profiling sessions run
        for either 20 minutes or up to 10,000 SDK requests, whichever comes
        first.


        Once ended, a session’s `status` is `processing__sys` while Vault
        prepares the data, which may take about 15 minutes. Once the `status` is
        `complete__sys`, the data is available for download with the [Download
        Profiling Session
        Results](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Download_Profiling_Session_Results)
        endpoint.


        #### Example Response


        ``` json

        {
           "responseStatus": "SUCCESS"
        }
         ```

        #### Response Details


        On `SUCCESS`, the Vault ends the profiling session. The session’s
        `status` becomes `processing__sys` while Vault prepares the data, which
        may take about 15 minutes.

        Download the Profiler Log for a specific profiling session. A profiling
        session log is a CSV which contains one row for each SDK request, with a
        maximum of 100,000 rows.


        #### Example Response Headers


        ``` bash

        Content-Type: application/zip;charset=UTF-8

        Content-Disposition: attachment;filename="baseline__c.zip"

         ```

        #### Response Details


        On `SUCCESS`, Vault downloads the results of the specified profiling
        session. The HTTP Response Header `Content-Type` is set to
        `application/zip`. The HTTP Response Header `Content-Disposition`
        contains a filename component which can be used when naming the local
        file.


        The log is a CSV file with the following information for each SDK
        request:


        | Name | Description |

        | --- | --- |

        | `timestamp` | The time this SDK request began executing. |

        | `user_id` | The ID of the user who initiated this request. |

        | `user_name` | The user name of the user who initiated this request. |

        | `execution_id` | This SDK request’s execution ID. |

        | `sdk_request_id` | The ID of this SDK request. |

        | `sdk_count` | The number of SDK entry points evoked during this
        request. |

        | `sdk_cpu_time` | The CPU time, in nanoseconds. |

        | `sdk_elapsed_time` | The total elapsed time, in milliseconds. |

        | `sdk_gross_memory` | The memory consumed, in bytes. |

        [https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#API_Usage](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#API_Usage)


        Retrieve the **API Usage Log** for a single day, up to 30 days in the
        past. The log contains information such as user name, user ID, remaining
        burst limit, and the endpoint called. Users with the _Admin: Logs: API
        Usage Logs_ permission can access these logs.


        Note that the daily logs may have a delay of about 15 minutes. If your
        log does not include appropriate data, know that your data is not lost;
        it is just not yet populated.


        The logs are designed for troubleshooting burst limits and discovering
        which of your integrations are causing you to hit the limit. These logs
        should not be used for auditing, as they are not designed with the
        appropriate level of restrictions. For example, if an API request fails
        to enter the usage log, the API call is not prevented from executing,
        which would be required if this log was designed for auditing. In rare
        cases an API call may not show up as an entry in the log, but know that
        all calls are accurately reflected in your burst limit counts.


        #### Headers


        Note that this `Accept` header only changes the format of the response
        in the case of an error. This does not change the file format of the
        download.


        | Name | Description |

        | --- | --- |

        | `Accept` | `application/json` (default) or `application/xml` |


        #### Example Response Headers


        ``` bash

        Content-Type: application/octet-stream;charset=UTF-8

        Content-Disposition: attachment;filename="response.zip"

         ```

        #### Response Details


        On `SUCCESS`, Vault retrieves the log from the specified date as a .ZIP
        file. The HTTP Response Header `Content-Type` is set to
        `application/octet-stream`. The returned CSV or Logfile includes the

        | `connection` | The `api_name__sys` of the matching _Connection_ record
        associated with this request. If this is a trusted Veeva connection,
        such as Vault Loader, Vault Mobile, or Station Manager, this value is
        `vault__sys`. If there is no associated connection, this value is blank.
        |

        | `api_resource` | The API resource for the request. For example, the
        primary query object for a VQL request. |

        | `api_response_warning_type` | The API request warning type. For
        example, `DUPLICATE`. |

        https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Upload_to_Session



        The session owner can upload parts of a file to an active upload
        session. By default, you can upload up to 2000 parts per upload session,
        and each part can be up to 50MB.  Use the `Range` header to specify the
        range of bytes for each upload, or split files into parts and add each
        part as a separate file. Each part must be the same size, except for the
        last part in the upload session.

        Import a bulk translation file into Vault. While an exported bulk
        translation file can contain only one (1) language, your import file may
        include multiple languages. Vault reads the language value separately
        for each row and applies any new translations immediately. Vault ignores
        any rows without changes. Learn more about the [translation file schema
        in Vault
        Help](https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/13309/#field-labels-and-system-messages-translation-file).


        You must have the _Admin: Language: Edit_ permission to import a bulk
        translation file to Vault.


        Upload the CSV file to your Vault’s file staging server before making
        this request.


        - The maximum CSV input file size is 1GB.

        - The values in the input must be UTF-8 encoded.

        - CSVs must follow the standard RFC 4180 format, with some
        [exceptions](https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#CSV_RFC_Deviations).
            

        #### Response Details


        On `SUCCESS`, the response includes the `job_id` which allows you to:


        - [Retrieve the job
        status](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_Job_Status),
        which specifies if the import job has completed with `SUCCESS`

        - [Retrieve the job
        summary](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Translation_Summary),
        which provides details of a successful job

        - [Retrieve the job
        errors](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Translation_Errors),
        which provides details about the errors encountered in the job (if any)

        Moves up a `scheduled` job instance to start immediately. Each time a
        user calls this API, Vault cancels the next scheduled instance of the
        specified job. For example, calling this API against a scheduled daily
        job three times would cause the job to not run according to its schedule
        for three days. Once the affected Job ID is complete, Vault will
        schedule the next instance.


        This is analogous to the *Start Now* option in the Vault UI.

        Add or replace client code in Vault by uploading a ZIP file of the
        client code distribution. Vault unpacks and compares the uploaded
        distribution with other distributions in the Vault and:


        - Adds the distribution if the distribution name is new.
            
        - Replaces a distribution if it has the same name and the client code
        filenames or contents are different.
            
        - Makes no changes if the distribution name exists and the code is the
        same.
            

        To upload the file, use the multi-part attachment with the file
        component "file={file_name}". The maximum allowed total file size for
        all distributions in a Vault is 50 MB.
